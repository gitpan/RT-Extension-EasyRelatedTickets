RT-Extension-EasyRelatedTickets version 0.1

This will add 'Create' Links next to each of the relationship types in the
ticket links box on the ticket display page, so you can easily create 
related tickets with information prefilled ;)

Caveat: this works only if your RT's ticket create page has ticket clone function.
Also, it'll be into the core in version 3.8.

How to install:

if you haven't installed RT yet:

1. PREFIX=PATH/TO/RT perl Makefile.PL
2. make
3. make install ( maybe need root permission )

elsif you have installed RT already, you can just copy the files in html 
directory to your rt's html directory, then you'd better clear cache and
restart your web server.

Good Luck! :)
